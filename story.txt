This is my story, the character is Brad and this story is set in QQ Express.
Brad was very hungry, so he ordered some bread for dinner. Brad realized that QQ is a horrible place to dine. So, he sued the establishment for producing such vile food
But then he realized that it's only 7ish bucks, so instead he got double peanut butter chickens for lunch..

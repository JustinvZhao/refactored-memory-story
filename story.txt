This is my story, the character is Brad and this story is set in QQ Express.
Brad was very hungry, so he ordered some bread for dinner. Brad realized that QQ is a horrible place to dine. So, he sued the establishment for producing such vile food
But then he realized that it's only 7ish bucks, so instead he got double peanut butter chickens for lunch..

First, you have a lot of arrogant nerve mouthing off like that.  I do not suffer fools.
Second, you are the only person who is complaining; everyone else seems to have found it on the course website just fine... homework, exam dates, etc.  I am not posting things twice for your petty convenience.  If you can't find it, that's tough, engineer.
Third, learn how to spell.
Fourth, if you ever send me an insulting email like this again, I will automatically dock you 15 points on the exam, and have a word with the School of Engineering regarding your disrespectful behavior to a professor, or perhaps a future supervisor, if you intend to work in this field.

So I suggest that you deal with it like everybody else.

"Sorry professor I just wanted to know where to find the midterm dates on your website."

And that was the story of Brad, who went to find food but instead received a verbal thrashing from his professor. Better luck next time Brad!
